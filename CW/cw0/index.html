        Users of HTML are sometimes surprised to find that HTML gives them little control over the
        way that a page is displayed. It should be remembered that HTML was developed as a means
        of marking up the structure of a document not as a way of determining its presentation.
        Formatting text to appear on a Web page is therefore different from formatting text to appear
        in a printed document.
        This
        is
        Cool.
